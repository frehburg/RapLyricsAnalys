Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy

I made my first million, I'm like, ""Shit, this is it,"" ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
And I can't ever tell you no

Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""

Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy

Das ist TR3YWAY!
König von New York, sucht nach der Königin
Ah, du hast die Richtige
L-Lass es diese-l-lass es diese S-S-Schlampen wissen, Nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, prr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Part 1: 6ix9ine]
Muschi ist nass, nass, und es tropft, tropft
Ist eine Spritzpistole, fick sie, sie ist ein Fefe
Ihr Name Keke, sie bläst meinen Schwanz als sei er gratis, gratis
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich das getan?“
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich sie gefickt?“
Ich weiß nur, dass ich sie nicht zu meiner Frau machen kann
Bin nett zu ihr, damit sie sich nicht wehrt
Drehe um und fick es von hinten, hinten, hinten
Beuge sie runter und lass es klatschen, klatschen, klatschen
[Hook: 6ix9ine]
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde, nein

[Part 2: 6ix9ine]
Draco hat den Rückstoß, wenn ich schieße, werden sie zu Leichtathleten
Sie schießen nicht zurück, ein Schuss, Nahdistanz, roter Punkt
Kopf platzt, ja, ich hab's getan, ja, das ist mein Leben
Rufe einen Uber mit meinen Schützen, mit einem Ruger, wir erledigen dich
Typen sagen, sie töten Leute, doch ich tu es wirklich

Er-Er will 69 wie Tekashi, nenn' ihn Papi
Shoutout an A$AP, halte mich mit Diamanten bestückt, ich komme aus New York, also bin ich frech
Sagt, er mag meine Bande, kaufte mir Chloé wie Kardashi
Hält meine Muschi in Versace, sagte ich bin schön so wie Tinashe
Halt-Halte es alles in sein Gesicht, wurde ich angeklagt?
Soeben ist jemand meinem Pussy-Game erlitten, doch ich hinterlasse nie eine Spur
Gesicht so schön, Arsch langt für Tage, ich bekomme Chips, ich frage nach Lay's
Ich lehne mich nur zurück, wenn er fertig ist und frage, „Wie hat es geschmeckt?“

At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""

She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I —
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever

My bitch drive an all-white Range
Couldn't hit it if you niggas had aim
Lames can't call and you a lame
You had it then you lost it, Hall of Shame
I can buy a Bentley, don't talk to me
For a show 150, don't talk to me
You ain't never helped your mans, don't talk to me
You just follow all the trends, don't talk to me
Ayy, I set the bar, I'm the fuckin' bar
Look in the sky, I'm a fuckin' star
I don't fall in love 'cause I be lovin' hard
Do everything like my shirt, extra large
I don't care, I'll crash a Ghost
Got two cribs in two states, I be doing the most
I got white-folks money that I won't blow
And if you ask why, 'cause the white folks don't

Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me!

36,Lemon,N*E*R*D & Rihanna,2018,"Natural Born Kickeur III LyricsC'est pas un drame si j'atteins pas l'platine
Les rappeurs mentent, ils ont l'jeu d'acteur de Palpatine
En bas d'chez moi ça baroude, j'dirais plutôt ""ça barrode""
Déjà rentré des patates, déjà rentré des carottes
Des grosses voitures, voilà l'image qu'on véhicule
J'ai plongé dans l'illicite, les études comme pédiluve
La vie m'a fait de grands dégâts, je valais rien au top départ
Aujourd'hui j'fais ma vendetta, casse des bouches et tape des barres
J'arrive, bibendum, se-pha dans le barillet
Si j'déménage, peut-être que mes thèmes pourront varier
Paris est pas si magique, veux-tu parier
Des mecs de tess avec des sapes de marque et les dents cariées
T'as fait ci, t'as fait ça, ta té-ci n'est pas si sale
J'apprécie pas ton rap, que des bêtises abyssales
Là où j'vis, même les raclis veulent des couilles en or
J'encaisse les thunes et les coups, pas du clan des couillonneurs
Ceux qui sont pas contents n'ont qu'à s'lever
Dans la rue, si tu manques de flair, on te casse le nez
La punchline est complète, aucune demi-mesure
Si j'te dis qu't'es hors compète, tu réponds ""oui monsieur""
L'idéal : veski les keufs et la mettre aux meufs
Jamais tué personne, comme un neuf millimètres neuf
M'égaler, ceux qui le croient sont bé-chtar
Y en a très peu à ma taille, comme les jeans à G-Star
J'ai enterré mes rêves de gosse devant le zapping
On pleure plus en public, même si parfois ça pique
Ils nous diabolisent, c'est qu'un vice de plus
On est des enfants d'la télé, eux des fils de pute
Torrent d'cyprine quand ta bitch entend mon nom
2012, le ton a durci, j'mets du vin dans mon eau
Le peura ça vend pas, n'écoute pas c'qui s'évente
Deux-mille téléchargements, enlève deux zéros pour les ventes
Toujours pas au goût des élégantes dames
La vraie beauté est intérieure, à part pour Elephant Man
Allez nique ta race, toi et tes r'frains chantonnés
Ça sort les teilles de champagne, leur public boit du Champomy
Coffee G., on ouvre les portes avec des clés d'bras
Tes blessures, c'est rien, comparé à nos plaies d'braves
Casserole sur la plaque, méfiez-vous de l'eau qui dort
Ma fierté ne s'achète pas, même contre des lokis d'or
Tise et drogue, malheureusement c'qui fait tourner l'four
Triste époque, le marchand d'sable passe au Redbull
J'voulais graisser les épinards, mais téma le prix d'la crème
J'ai vu les grands faire du blé, alors j'en ai pris d'la graine
On s'en sert peu, on vient remettre le couvert
Levez les majeurs, moi j'm'en bats les reins des pouces verts
Piano-zouk-électro, les mecs de tess m'ont déçu
Y'aurait des strings Prada, ils se jetteraient tous dessus
Visent la plus belle, chouf un peu à quoi ça mène
Amène les camions-poubelles, beaucoup trop de sacs à merde
Provoque pas trop, même si j'ai le cœur à Coluche
Avant qu'je sorte les griffes, on me prenait pour une peluche
Pas de grand public, uniquement des chrysanthèmes
J'élargirai pas mon boule pour élargir ma clientèle
Manque de nettoyage, les nuls se banalisent tant
N'importe qui s'incruste, comme en Afghanistan
Sois tranquille, on se charge d'écumer
Les rappeurs veulent me mettre un patch pour que j'arrête de les fumer
Peu importe la couleur, ensemble on fait des merveilles
On saigne tous, notre rap est dans la même veine
Blanc, jaune, métissé, couleur ébène
La route est longue entre le square Léon et le jardin d'Éden
Dérange pas si ça dîne, les concurrents, j'les abîme
Je prends du poids, les asticots se lèchent les babines
Baise les nouveaux puristes, jeunes mais déjà séniles
Ils écouteraient même du Bieber, du moment qu'c'est sur vinyle
J'ai changé depuis la dernière fois
J'suis pas une star, j'fais couler l'sang, le tapis rouge, il est derrière moi
Pessimiste, avec quelques sautes d'humour
Recule de quelques pas, y a qu'mes poignées qui sont d'amour
Ton buzz est dead, et ta cote se meurt
J't'anéantis en un clin d'œil, à la Scott Summers
Trop de bâtards, j'demande qu'à les achever
Pour les compter sur mes doigts, y m'faudrait le corps à Shiva
Le rôle de l'antihéros, chaque cité a son barde
On a des gueules de terros, avec ou sans la barbe
Demande pas si ça roule à un brancardier
Mon arrondissement est riche, contrairement à mon quartier
J'ai le blues de l'école ""Hoochie Coochie Man""
Viens pas demander un feat' si t'as le flow à Gucci Mane
Chez moi, y a que les Marocains qui partent au Maroc
Poésie baroque, gris et solide comme un roc
Pas sérieux, ça baise des 'tasses pas très malignes
J'écrirais pas comme ça sans garder cette adrénaline
T'avais juré d'arrêter, mais tu la tires d'un trait la ligne
Personne n'a témoigné de ce qui s'passe après la vie
Appelle-moi Toubab Shakur, a.k.a. l'baron
J'leur mets tellement de gifles qu'ils m'confondent avec le daron
Belek à ma big team, baise tout et casse les murs
T'es qu'une victime, même sur Facebook, tu rases les murs
C'est qu'on est pas passés par là si tu vois pas d'sang
T'avais prévu d'exploser, j'ai entendu qu'un clac-doigt
T'avais du buzz, t'as flambé, t'as vendu quatre-cent
T'arrêtes pour raison religieuses, allez casse-toi
Y a les statues géantes et y a les figurines
Y a ceux qui grattent des seize mesures et ceux qui grattent des featurings
Ceux qui lâchent un son par an et ceux qui saignent à l'usine
Ceux qui accusent la distrib' et ceux qui améliorent leur musique
J'vise pas l'oscar, propos limites
Ça m'est égal que la critique ma taille une pipe ou un costard
J'étais juste venu boire, ils m'ont fait trinquer
Mutilation du track, tu kiffes pas, t'es détraqué
Rangez vos albums, c'est d'la qualité bootleg
Leur son tourne en rond, et le mien tourne en boucle
Ça sonne sale malgré la qualité sonore
Chaque mesure fait mal, tu vas valider l'ceau-mor
Que des joueurs de trompette, sortez les cuivres
J'me renseigne sur les modes pour être sûr de pas les suivre
Grosse merde, crari tu fréquentes les hautes sphères
Ferme un peu ta grande gueule, tu pollues mon atmosphère
Ton flow est sucré, moi j'utilise des mots amers
Le rap sans moi, comme une cité sans famille Mohamed
Tu loues des Ferrari, alors qu'tu roules en Lada
J'vais pas viser ta tête, vu qu'elle te sert à nada
Ni le tiékar ni la Lune, j'vise la galaxie
J'me prends pas pour un Noir, nique le Galak
Si ça fonctionne pas, j'passe au rock à la Barrett Syd
Mes potes sont des vrais, pas des gratteurs de garette-ci
Ça cherche des méthodes pour du talent, pourtant y en a pas quarante
T'as vendu ton âme au diable, apparemment tu t'es fait carotte
Tu pues la défaite, que des phases pour gamines
Et tu fais plus de name-dropping que Raito Yagami
Ceux qui ont le moins sont ceux qui montrent le plus
Le temps passe aussi vite sur une montre de luxe
Je danse pas, je mate les culs, près d'la buvette
Me parle pas d'vécu, j'ai vu plus de merde qu'une cuvette
Ma mission : tuer les faux, bien sûr dédicacer les bons
Mon flow est lourd, il a peur de traverser les ponts
Ils veulent ma mort, j'les vois en face, ils s'mettent en r'trait
PD, tu vas rien faire, va jouer aux fléchettes sur mon portrait
Je rappe mieux qu'toi, c'est une certitude
Essaie de nous maquer, tu vas connaître la servitude
Qui veut voler mon or, mon art
La rondelle en bon état, y a qu'à la science que j'peux donner mon corps
Tu sais qui c'est, pas b'soin de répétition
Dis c'que tu veux, j'écouterai pas, t'es comme le diététicien
Tout c'qui m'sépare des mecs en major, c'est le manque de sous
Les beatmakers, avis à vous, braqueur de banques de sons
J'amène du sang frais, j'attire les piranhas
T'as testé, t'as mérité ta gifle comme Rihanna
C'est pas du hard rock, mais j'veux voir des pogos
Si c'était moi qu'avait croqué, Apple n'aurait plus d'logo
J'ai violé l'instru, j'ai ma place au PS
Tu critiques mais tu branles rien, comme le prof d'EPS
Le rap a pécho l'HIV, ce titre est là pour l'achever
Ne pas déranger, j'écris votre futur album de chevet
Cevi t'es gang, t'es inconnu en tess
Tu vas en voir de toutes les couleurs comme une shneck hollandaise
Sur ma tête pas d'auréole, tout sauf malléable
Représente les halls, sûrement pas les Halles
J'perds mon temps à espérer que jamais mon réveille sonne
Gratter des putain d'phases écoutées par cinquante personnes
Ça bicrave pour grailler autre chose que des döners
C'est pas une question d'bonheur, c'est une question d'honneur
C'est pas d'la snap, Bazoo jamais loin du snack
Des envies d'autodafé dès que j'mets les pieds en Fnac
Ils parlent de Merco, j'connais l'numéro d'bus de ces tomis
Habitué d'la street, j'ai chauffé l'banc, plus que Citony
Joue pas l'cow-boy, sinon tu finis scalpé
L'union fait la force, à part pour ton équipe de dalepés
Avant d'lâcher ma passion, je périrai
Si le rap se montre patient, j'le guérirai
Bûcheron, révolue l'époque timorée

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

Und sie möchte nur Rache üben und zurückkommen
Es ist ein Schachspiel, sie ist hinter ihm her wie ein Jetpack
Sie behält die Übersicht über all seine Internetchats
Und ratet, wer gerade dabei ist, zur Nächsten weiterzuziehen
Tatsächlich, gerade auf mein letztes Mädchen gekackt und sie hat, was meiner Ex fehlt
Denn sie liebt Gefahr, Psychopath
Und du fickst mit niemandes Mädchen, selbst ich weiß das
Aber sie hat einen Plan entwickelt, ihm in den Rücken zu stechen
Messer in der Hand, sagt, dass ihre Beziehung an einer Strähne hängt
Also war sie neuerdings im Netz
Sagt, vielleicht wird sie meine Gwen Stacy sein, um ihren Mann zu ärgern
Und ich weiß, sie benutzt mich, um zu versuchen, ihn zu betrügen, mir egal
Hi Suzanne, aber ich hätte sagen sollen: „Bye Suzanne“
Nach der ersten Nacht, aber heute Nacht bin ich
[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

[Bridge: Eminem]
One-Night-Stand, wurde zu einem Two-Night-Stand
Es war „Komm, Sonnenlicht, verschwinde“, jetzt umarmen wir uns fest und...

[Part 2: Eminem]
Er hat es rausgefunden, jetzt fühlt sie sich verlassen und benutzt
Denn er ist abgehauen, na und? Er hat es ihr außerdem zuerst angetan
Wie soll ich jetzt diesem Mädchen sagen, dass wir fertig sind?
Es ist hart, die Worte zu finden, ich bin reserviert, nervös, und Sue
Möchte nicht, dass das wehtut, aber was du verdienst ist die Wahrheit
Nimm es nicht persönlich, ich kann es dir einfach nicht persönlich sagen
Also kehre ich ins Studio zurück, wie Rattenloch-Diner
Muss in einer Kabine nicht reserviert sein
Ich fühle mich nur so, als wäre die Person, zu der ich werde
Unumkehrbar, ich habe auf dich Jagd gemacht, als wäre es Kirche auf der Kirchenbank
Und jetzt, wo ich dich habe, will ich dich nicht
Nutzte den Vorteil in meinem Verfolgungsdurst
Warum mache ich diesen Dreck, den ich mache?
Steige auf meine Tribüne und predige meine Predigt und Rede
Reinigungsmittel und Bleiche verbrennen die Wunde
Denn jetzt, mit ihr im Mutterleib
Können wir sie nicht in diese Welt bringen, hätten daran denken sollen
Schutz zu verwenden, bevor ich in deine verbotene Frucht gebissen habe
Fuck!

Nennt mich (ooh), nennt mich (ooh)

[Part 3]
Immer die Brautjunger, niemals „die Braut, hey“
Was zum Teufel soll ich sagen? Wenn das Leben eine Schnellstraße wäre
Und Betrug eine Enklave, würde ich über fünf Fahrspuren schlingern
Die Geschwindigkeit ist enorm, als würde ich auf Eis rutschen, vielleicht
Ist das, warum ich dich vielleicht von der Seite angemacht habe
Ich kann meine Lügen nicht beisammen halten
Aber ich brachte dich dazu, mein Baby aufzulösen
Diese Dreiecksbeziehung ließ uns im Ruin zurück, verwirrt
Was kann ich noch sagen? Es hat eine Zeit lang Spaß gemacht
Wette, ich hätte dein Lächeln wirklich geliebt
Wollte nicht wirklich abtreiben, aber scheiß drauf
Was ist eine Lüge mehr, die wir unserem ungeborenen Kind erzählen?
[Refrain: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines (es tut mir leid)
Ich möchte nichts zugeben (ich habe es vermasselt)
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist

Don't get close to me
Hugging my Rosary
I say lord
Mama would hustle
The Honda Accord
Daddy would stunt
He would pull up at ac
Fancy Rolex
With a Cuban to match
Back when they call me young nene the kid
Back I use to put on the throwback
Back when I use to just play the backcourt
Back when  I use to wear the jansport

Just the rhyme book I swear
Pull up to the show
And queens  and Brooklyn here
Yeah you know it
Baby I'm a poet
Playa playa
And I play heroic
I ain't saving hoes
Screaming fuck the labels
As I walk in  label door
I'm a labor man
I'm a work horse
Even when I stay at home
I don't never take work off
Before I sweat a bitch
I rather porn Hub
And Just jerk off
You a jerk off
Like stone cold
With a six pack
With the beer belly
And the shirt off
Hit with the stunner
Man I just had the worse  summer
So I'm kicking doors
And breaking numbers
Kicking like the baby
In your baby mama
She Gon make hit with the anacoda
Bless her with the force and some marijuana
With no Benny Hanna
Just some chicken nuggets
Gucci gold
I Told her
To give me the coochie to go
I told her to rub
On my coogie for luck
I told her
Don't act like she booshie as fuck
I told her
Go listen to Gucci instead
I got me a yella
She bump the Kodak
I met her miami
That night in the sand
I told her to read all the signs in my hand
She told me the vision was safe and clear
She wanted a Kodak
A pic from the gram
She told me I was becoming a man
The picture Was only because I'm the man
I was just a baby boy
Getting picked up at the crib
Getting dropped off at my school

Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days
[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change

Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now

At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail

[Intro]
D.A. tem aquela droga!

[Refrão 1: Travis Scott]
Água gelada, virou Atlântica (Congelou)
De noite em um Phantom (Skrrt, Skrrt)
Falei pra essas putas não entrarem em pânico
Tomei uma ilha, (Yeah) inundou a mansão (Muita água)
Abaixei o teto, mais expansão
Dirija um carro em que você possa ficar (It's lit)
Vejo as vadias cobertas (Nos lençóis)
Eu sou um amante de bundas e peitos (Bunda grande)
Acho que todos nós fizemos um pro outro
Agora que todos os parças estão livres (Yeah, yeah)
E estamos fora nessas ruas (Tudo bem)
Você pode fazer isso, você pode rebolar pra mim?
[Refrão 2: Kodak Black]
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)

[Verso 1: Offset]
Offset!
Explodi os miolos do carro (Boom)
A polícia quer falar, mas eu tô no mudo (Woo-woo, hey)
Vou cravejar o pulso dela porque ela é fofa (Ice, ice)
Transo com ela em um iate, mergulho numa piscina (Yeah)
Ela é viciada (Viciada), viciada pelo estilo de vida e pelo Patek (Patek)
Paizão, você já sentiu os tecidos da Chanel? (Chanel)
Vou ser estiloso até a morte, preciso de um caixão (Estiloso)
E temos mais listras do que o árbitro, ele falta, TEC nele (Bow, listras)
No meio do campo igual o David Beckham (Campo, bow-bow)
Todos os meus manos presos, de verdade, tô tentando ajudá-los (Liberdade, Liberdade)
Quando eu ganhei um milhão, me deu arrepios, não sei o que aconteceu (Hoo, arrepios)
Tomo pílulas, faço o que eu quero, eu tô naquele zumbi (Hey, hoo)
Eu sou mais o Gaddafi, não sou nenhum Gandhi (Gaddafi, hey)
Eu sou mais o David, Golias correndo (Hey, hey)
Os manos são clonados, eu acho engraçado (Clone, haha)
Somos do Nawf, direto da masmorra (Somos do Nawf, hey)
Eu vou na boca dela, ela não pode me dizer nada (Eghck, eghck, egchk)
300, o relógio tá fora do seu orçamento (Woo, woo, 300)
A maldade me pegou
Yeah, e essa arma saiu direto da Rússia

[Verso 2: Kodak Black]
Em um Hellcat porque eu fui criado no inferno
Homem feito, eu não devo favor pra nenhum mano
Quando você conseguir esse dinheiro, mano, mantenha seu coração
Eu tô deslizando no carro, não precisa de chave pra ligar
Eu levo a arma comigo no BET Awards
Quando seu poço secar, você sabe que precisa de mim pra isso
Quando eu estaciono no Buick, você sabe o que tô fazendo
Se a polícia ficar atrás de mim, eu vou fugir e vazar
Dormindo na paleta me transformou em um selvagem
Eu sou um bebê do projeto, agora moro em Calabasas
Como se eu ainda servisse aos demônios, como se ainda estivesse afirmando
Eu tô bebendo lean, tento manter o equilíbrio
Andando naquela Z-Walk, Dickie's com meus Reeboks
Eu não falo muito, apenas deixo a arma falar
Suas joias mexem na água, diamantes tipo re-rock
Minha mina cavalga no pau como se tivesse numa gangorra
Quando eu entrei na cena, eu tava com uma mira
Quando eu entrei na Beam', eu tava de Celine
Garotinha, você é apenas uma aventura, não é isso que quero dizer
Dinheiro pulando pra fora do meu jeans, igual eu faço o esquema
[Refrão 2: Kodak Black]
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)

Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave
[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Iceberg want a bag, bitch

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane
[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate

Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time
[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, ""It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye""
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines

Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide

Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life

Don't point a finger, this shit can get dangerous

""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""

And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I’m changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin’ like I’m gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

Por que eu sou durão, você não vai gostar de mim

[Refrão 1: YNW Melly & Kanye West]
Diga que você quer alguém
Diga que você quer alguém
Disse que você quer alguém
Diga que você quer alguém

[Refrão 2: Kanye West]
Eu acho que tenho personalidades mistas
Essa puta mudou toda minha mentalidade
Essa mina, ela tem personalidades mistas
Um dia ela tá feliz, no outro ela tá brava comigo
[Pós-Refrão: YNW Melly]
Diga que você quer alguém que vai te amar
Alguém que possa te satisfazer
Alguém que pode te beijar e massagear
Te foder assim, te foder daquele jeito

[Verso 1: Kanye West & YNW Melly]
Oh, agora eu tenho personalidades mistas
Ela me deixou estressado, cantando melodias
Por ela eu juro que cometeria um crime
Oh, Penelope

[Refrão: Kanye West & YNW Melly]
Diga que você quer alguém
Diga que você quer alguém
Disse que você quer alguém
Disse que você quer alguém

[Verso 2: YNW Melly]
Eu juro por Deus que essa mina tá chapando, parça
Um dia ela tá com os Bloods, no outro com os Crips, parça
Você sabe que eu coloco nos rins dela, parça
Ela tá gritando, ela precisa de Lithanol
Ela tá bloqueando, ignorando minhas ligações (Bloqueando, ignorando minhas ligações)
Ela continua bloqueando, ignorando minhas ligações (Bloqueando, ignorando minhas ligações)
Eu tô no fundo dela, eu vou derrubar as paredes dela (Derruba elas, boom)
Essa mina tá agitada, ela precisa de um Adderall (Oh, não)

Um dia ela tá feliz, depois brava comigo

Diga que você quer alguém que vai te amar
Alguém que possa te satisfazer
Alguém que pode te beijar e massagear
Te foder assim, te foder daquele jeito

[Verso 3: YNW Melly]
Oh, Deus, eu nunca estive aqui antes, oh, não
Oh, continua pressionando ignorar, oh, não
Ela continua ignorando minhas ligações e me bloqueando em tudo
Vadia, oh, não
Oh, e é minha culpa, hummm
Eu tenho as chaves do coração da putinha e você não pode ter o cofre (Yeah)
Melhor ir buscar o chaveiro, melhor ir buscar sua Glock, puta
Chega de frente com o oponente se ele tiver mexendo com a minha mina
Essa é minha gata, essa é minha mina, esse é meu tudo (Tudo)
Essa é minha vadia pra sempre, não precisamos de anel de casamento (Sem anel de casamento)
Eu vou dar o mundo pra ela, bolinhas no pijama novo dela
Levar a vadia pro Bahamas, deixar a cachorra comer no Benihana (Benihana)
Na real, não quero conhecer sua mãe (Conhecer a mãe dela)
Foder ela, daquele outro jeito (Até o fim)
Foder ela, é, do outro jeito (Jeito certo)
Foder ela, é, do jeito bandido (Jeito de bandido)
Batendo na sua porta (Porta), tentando te dar seu amor (Amor, amor)
Você fica me dizendo (Amor), que você não tá nem ai (Porra, porra)
[Ponte: YNW Melly]
Você não vai achar ninguém que pode te foder igual eu te fodo, bebê
Você não vai achar ninguém que pode te foder igual eu te fodo, bebê
Você não vai achar ninguém que pode te foder igual eu te fodo, bebê
Mundo do Young Nigga e eu tenho o caminho dos Young Nigga

I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me

Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit

Tornato con il remix
Questi ragazzi tutti miei figli come Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
La mia città e il mio stato non hanno mai visto questo
Jimmy Neutron, sono un ragazzo prodigio (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Sul futon, le sto dando quel cazzo
Quando questa merda è pronta, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, come Gilbert Arenas, sparo il colpo
Sono ancora con i demoni, ooh, I keep it thorough
Ho cinque tipe a New York
Questo significa una in ogni quartiere
Sono nel pocket come Burrow
Quando sono tornato a casa, though
Mi trattano come Robert De Niro
La ho portata Taco Bell, le ho comprato un churro
La ho portata a casa, le ho dato un cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeri su zeri su zeri (Zeri)
Quello è cosa il bilancio del mio conto bancario dice (Woo)
Ho a check dalla compagnia di scarpe
Ora faccio qualsiasi cosa che dice New Balance
Le ho comprato un biglietto aereo, fuori di stato
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Ho detto, ""Sono in città oggi""
Lei ha detto che she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' quella merda
Così quando she pull up on me so cosa she 'bout to say
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & DaBaby]
Come butta?
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
Ho delle opzioni
Potrei passare quella puttana come Stockton (It ain't nothin')

Il mio corpo got rid of them toxins (Let me go, mmh, mmh)

Chiama la mia puttana, dille, ""Prendimi that noggin"" (Brrt)
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Chiamami DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
Sono un vero creativo and stylish, F&N nel mio denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back da L.A. sul jet ieri (Nyoom)
I go back and forth come se giocassi a tennis
Fotto con la tua puttana, yeah, I'm fit for it
Ancora su Billboard, la canzone numero uno nel Regno Unito
And I done got so fuckin' rich, tutte queste puttane sul mio cazzo
Non mi frega ancora un cazzo di cosa mi dicono
Lei lo mangia come Pac-Man, negro (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga come se fossi Batman, negro (Eat it)
I just pulled up nella Batmobile (Nyoom)
La ragione per cui non fotto con questi rap-ass negri
Perché loro sono cap-ass negri (Cap)
E il loro rap non è vero (Cap)
Credimi, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, bisogno di un Squeegee
These niggas watered down, loro bevono Fiji
La mia auto è arancione e marrone come se fossi a Cleveland
La mia puttana è Mello Yello come una soda (Soda)
Questi negri tattletalers, io sono un soldato
Ayy, qualcuno dica a questi negri che è finita
Tu sai è Baby, negro

She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler in case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again

I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper
[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless

Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net

Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah
[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve

Люблю тебя, когда ты распускаешь свои волосы без расчёски
И я остаюсь для себя, потому что я никогда не любил этих шлюх (Да)

Почему я должен тратить своё время на шоути, у которой я не на переднем плане?
Особенно, когда ты получаешь дизайнерскую одежду и я пою вином и угощаю обедом
И Bentley пришёл с крыльями, как номер девять, да
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу

Ты можешь валять дурака, если хочешь, если хочешь
На Бали, большие качели, большое платье
Большая жопа, заставляю её сквиртить и делать большую грязь
До того, как мы закончили, она спросила ""Где мы займёмся этим в следующий раз?""
Дальше, так мокро, что испортили сиденья в самолёте

30,The Bigger Picture,Lil Baby,2020,"TranslationsTürkçeEnglishThe Bigger Picture Lyrics[Intro]
Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white

31,Godzilla,Eminem Featuring Juice WRLD,2020,"Russian cover  - Godzilla (Eminem feat. Juice WRLD) LyricsОх, да ты просто монстр

[Куплет 1: Dicon]
Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла
Попаду в колоду, будто крупье в казино
Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана ""Мозга"" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...
[Припев: Dicon]
Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

[Куплет 2: Dicon]
Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну
Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу
Магический шар
В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!
Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...

Чел стой
Смотри что в планах!

But I'm tired of being tired of being tired

See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down

The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active

Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)

[Couplet 1 : Young Thug]
Maintenant, ma belle dit qu'elle veut sucer le bout
C'est mon délire, bébé, je veux tes quatre lèvres (Mon délire)
Ex-camarade de classe, elle peut enfoncer un bateau
J'mange la molly et j'vais tripper cette salope
Ouais, ma belle, ouais, chérie, ouais, mon bébé, suce mes parties
Ferme les yeux, c'est juste toi et moi et personne
Ouais, suce-le sur le côté, qu'on soit en public ou sur la route (Hey)
Des sensations dans cette pute (Wouh), des sensations sur un jet (Wouh)

Coupé rouge, le bruit des montagnes russes
Ces jours-ci, j'équilibre toute la haine avec de l'amour
Ces jours-ci, je verse toute ma douleur dans un verre (Glou glou)
Rêveur, c'est qu'un effet secondaire quand tu es avec nous (Le jeu)
Du calme, les gars sont juste derrière moi, ils sont sur les nerfs
Crois-moi, on sort en ville pour amasser (Ouh)
Des sensations dans cette salope, ils sont surpris que je sois encore en vie (C'est lourd)

I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East, ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace

Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

Baby keep it real with his people

And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (Woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek

Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close

I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway

And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind

And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind

I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter

She told me she like how I'm dressin' and I ain't eatin' no salad (Uh-huh)
Stevie Wonder can see that I'm havin'
I told her, ""Be patient,"" she waited
I gave her the dick, she walked out doin' the ""Beat Box Challenge""
Like yeah, get in there, baby (Get in there)
You know me, hit you anywhere, baby (Let's go)
Know she gon' do whatever I say
I could piss in a cup, call it lemonade, baby
Let that bitch off, I'm a renegade, baby
I'ma get outta there, I ain't feelin' that (Huh?)
Nigga run up on me with a cellphone out
He gon' fuck around, die on the internet (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Fuck it, kill him on IG Live
Let the whole world see the nigga die (Die)
Yeah, shout-out to SpotEm', we got 'em (Get down)
Even though he a rapper, he shot him
I get this big pretty-ass smile from my mama (Cheese)
Get this motherfuckin' voice from my daddy
I learned how to pimp on them hoes from my uncle (Pimp, pimp)
Let her suck on my toes 'cause I'm nasty (Okay)
Like fuck it, she asked me to do it
Play with me, I'ma actually shoot you
Most of these niggas be cap and we knew it
These niggas drop shit and we laugh at they music
I know how to murder these niggas with kindness
Fuckin' they bitch from the back, how I do it
I buy a Cuban and fill it with diamonds
Send my assistant to pick up some condoms
Instagram model at the hotel textin' me now
Want me to give her the Johnson
Damn, that nigga Baby on fire and it won't go out
They know that lil' nigga's a problem
Got a big .45 on decock (Go)
Usin' big words like I'm T.I. (Turn up)
Don't wanna get me started, nigga
Turn me up, niggas gon' see why
Nigga, you a bitch, JoJo Siwa (Bitch)
You let the wrong nigga get rich
Both of these chains on my neck, they compete with each other
They fightin' and throwin' a fit
Know how these hoes like to argue and beef with each other
She fightin' now, over the dick
You should already know you ain't searchin' DaBaby
'Cause that nigga like to come in with the stick
I don't like to get into the mix (No)
I done got paid in full, my nigga
I get them hoes like I'm Mitch
Even got white people all on my dick (Go)
Yeah, second year, six-time Grammy-nominated
Came through turnt up, everybody hated
Before I had my first M, it was Billion Dollar Baby
He bet the house and his self like Las Vegas (Go)
You want the shit? Gotta earn it
He off the leash, he don't think he can get murdered
Know how to swim, so I fuck with who fuckin' with me
I take a bridge and I burn it
Let me see if you can swim, lil' nigga
Shit gettin' out of hand, I just parked a new Benz
Hopped in a new Benz, lil' nigga (Let's go)
And Ion't want new friends

[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 5: Polo G]
FN knock his head off (Knock his head off)
Fuck the jakes, we sped off (Fuck the jakes, we sped off)
Dissin' on the 'net 'bout Ed and Lil Bid got his mans chalked
We gon' take his life, bitch, that's how much dissin' the dead cost
I put that lil' bag up on his wig, he got his dreads bought
Tried to run, them bullets hawked him down, we left his legs crossed
We can speak 'bout bitches or this money, don't do fed talk
Hundred on my wrist watch
AP make her lick cock
In a mansion I bought mama, with my lil' sis' making TikToks
Lil Jo let that stick pop
Smoke opps out the ziplock
We gon' leave a brick shot
Chase him out his flip-flops
Catch him on the day you play with us and get your bitch shot
See them lights and take 'em on the chase, don't do no pitstops
Too Turnt Gang, we drop the rakes
Kill 'em, what my chopper say
Fuck it, let that chopper spray
Caught him snoozin', shot his face
I was taught to get close on your man, don't shoot from blocks away
I call my lil' killer, ""What's the plan? Let's whack an opp today""
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, bitch (Bitch)

[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off

[Verse 6: NLE Choppa]
Brrt, Ayy, walk 'em down straight to the ground, we make sure that he don't get up (Damn E, this shit exclusive, don't get up)
Call the reverend and his momma (Yeah, gone), tell 'em, ""Come and pick him up"" (Come and pick him up)
I'ma smack you with this .40, askin', ""Is my Glizzy tucked?"" (Is my Glizzy tucked?)
Only like it sloppy, she gon' beatbox when she suckin' me (Come here, come here)
Told her, ""Bring a friend"", if she ever think about fuckin' me
Touchin' who? Touchin' me? To God where your ass gon' be (Brrt)
Leave him stuck and send him up like he fuckin' with Cardi B (Brrt, brrt, brrt)
Park the car before we hit the street, I'm hoppin' out on feet (Better on feet)
Get up close so I can see his teeth but I'ma keep it brief
Ask do he remember me, then introduced him to my heat (Remember me?)
Skrrt off the block, you followin' this car, your whip be cream cheese (Come here, brrt)
Ain't no bush to beat around, you not duckin' no hunnid rounds (Not duckin')
Whole hood been down, fuck the count 'cause we just beat it down ('Cause we just beat it down)
Ain't gotta spin back around because my target hit the ground (My target hit the ground)
Crossed that line, you out of bounds, they gon' find you up in the crowd (No, no)
Nappy-ass dreadlocks (Ayy), black Forces, black socks (Ayy, brrt)
Make the Draco pop (Brrt), it's louder than a boombox (Brrt, brrt)
Shoutout to OVO, this Drac' can make your bed rock (Make your bed rock)
We beat them four and oh, just check the score, it say a lot (Ayy, check the score, bitch)
Ayy, I'm in Miami, she givin' me head on Ocean Drive while her nigga outside
Sucked me so good, I thought that I died
But when I nutted, I had came back alive
Skeet on her face, it got in her eyes
Now she tellin' me she legally blind
Gave her a towel and told her she fine
She kept suckin' 'til she started cryin' (Come here, come here)
Point 'em out, shoot 'em out, I spot 'em, I got 'em (Come here)
He started runnin', so I caught 'em (Ayy, ayy)
Bag on his head, I bought 'em (Ayy)
Told my shooter do everything that I taught him (Ayy)
Let me know if it's a problem
Like a school boy, I be super quick to solve it
Thinkin' my shooter retarded
He take a pill and then snort it right off of his .40
Snort it right off of his gun (No)
Shot a hunnid, then paid a hunnid for his bond (No, no)
Send a diss, I won't respond (No)
Slam dunk a nigga like a nigga was LeBron (Come here)
Leave a nigga where he stay
Same place that I met him, I made him lay (Come here, come here)
Let a nigga come and play
He gon' tell his momma, ""Plan the funeral date"" (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
I got the power like Nelson Mandela
You need a umbrella whenever I spray (Whenever I spray)
Leave him shitty like Nutella
He gon' need a Pamper if he survive this K ('Vive this, ayy)
Me and my niggas, we down for whatever
We step on whoever in retro J's (Retro J's)
Bullet, stick like a thorn, call it Bella
Make him Cinderella if he betray, bitch

I'm strapped up wit' this jug, one in the head, already de-cocked (It's de-cocked)
I pop out when the beef hot, won't see me creepin' on your block (Nope, nope)
I work the back seat, we went three deep and got ten people shot (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
I hit the auto-switch and made it twerk and while he dumped the Glock (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Got the drop on all his spot, he gettin' robbed if he go or not
I know the taste and love Wock', he pourin' up in exotic pop
That booster hitter tried to pull a move and that shit got him dropped
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd, you pussies know what's up
Turn a nigga to a pack, we break 'em down and roll 'em up
Ain't shit changed but the whip, now it's a Rolls truck when I'm pulling up

I'm a nigga you should keep
Don't be asking who is me
Before I fuck you, Google me
Them comments don't be moving me
Fuck is they gon' do to me?
You do for me, I do for you (Yeah)
You cool with me, I'm cool with you
My momma said ""They using you, drop 'em and keep doing you""
I'm number one, they number two
My bank account gon' humble you
Took a Perc' and it ain't work, so I took two and felt like Durk
That pill make me wanna flirt
Fly a bad bitch out to Turks
Fuck her once and give her merch
Block a bitch, I bet she lurk
Hit and quit it, leave her hurt
Sometimes I feel like a jerk
She did me wrong, I did her worse
Fix it with a Louis purse
Throw the Lambo' in reverse
We skrt, uh yeah, we gon' throw the Lambo' in reverse
Throw that ass and make it twerk
We ran her, but I hit 'em first
All them bitches on The Shade Room wanna fuck me
Only if she lucky, I like sucky-sucky
They say she a ho, I don't know, but she love me
She came from Kentucky
I like how she fuck me
I like how these album sales got 'em talkin'
Bitch, I made a million off of ""Moonwalking in Calabasas""
Never bragging
I just hit this ghetto bitch, she hella ratchet
I just bought this Glock brand new it ain't got no attachments
Pew pew pew, pssht, boom boom, that bitch going off
I be in the club with hella chains on, I'm showing off
Bitch, I'm in my vibe and them comments tryna throw it off
Put a bitch on and she dipped that bitch throw the sauce

So much water on my neck, it's like I'm detoxin
Two drums and two sticks I'm beatboxin' (Grr, Hey)

Living in big houses from apartments, Bitch I made it out
My money and my loyalty, Two things I’ll never play about (hm, hm)
My oppositions tryna take me out (Okay)
And I'm fucked up in the head and they gon' make me bring my brazy out
Fuck what you thought ain't shit to think about (No, no)
A Twenty pack could get him whacked, Turn my head up ""Fuck it, lay him out""
We gon' ball regardless, Twenty bottles in my section, Look like alcoholics (Ooouuu)
Free my blooder, Murder gang, I hope you beat them charges (Gang)
I be on that private plane, Champagne when we departed, OG I'm the God
So much body on this bitch can't even park it
I don't never rep my jewelry (Skrr), If I were bitch I bought it (Facs)
That's cause I could afford it (Facs)
I've been fucking up these rap beats so long, It's getting boring now
They like ""M.A how you been?"" can't even call it
I just handle business, Mind my business, Feet up in my office
Prolly counting racks out, My stacks look like math books
The money turn me on, It's just some' bout ""how that cash look""
Bad bitch she need her ass whopped (need her ass whopped)
She a pretty lil dicky, But ay lil mama ""how that bag look?""
You look good but if you're broke then, That's a bad look
Turn around, Let me get that last a look (Ooouuu)

Fuck with me, gang'll do some' to you, make your tears drop
Hit 'em off, Wafi only boy, I don't Sears shop
Fuck around, might move to Michigan and get my peers hot
Trustworthy, uh, I think not, we'll wipe snot
Three lines, gon' make it look like wine in a clear pot
Ride around with the same weapon, ain't get deer shot
No rearviews in my life, leave that shit behind me
I was only eighteen years old when Kanye tried to sign me
Niggas gangsters online 'til you see 'em named Mahatma Gandhi
Better tell my bitch, ""Let's get a bitch that's tatted like Kehlani""
If she tell me yes, I'll let you know the when and where's to find me
Niggas already thinkin' that they wildin', steady tryna guide me
Finna blind me, standin' in my way, they need to get behind me
Every day I ride with a rocket just like my first name Johnny
White diamonds got more colors than a Murakami
Bitch thought I was Japanese, I folded just like origami
Used to sleep in front of Shoney's, now I got an eighty-inch Sony
Rich as hell, used to be broke, fucked up, eatin' bologna
Niggas not like us, we get to the money
How the fuck we wipe his nose and we still left it runnin'?
How you fly with nothin' to your name? Man, you niggas bummin'
'Member tryna get kids to game, they ain't listen to me

11,On Me,Lil Baby,2021,"On Me Lyrics[Intro]
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

[Verse 1]
Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong
[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

[Verse 2]
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch

Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)
[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я очень осторожный, как вор в ночи (Смотри)

[Куплет 1: Pop Smoke]
Если я зову тебя деткой, то ты детка на день
Или детка на ночь, ты не моя жена
Она хочет убийцу, чтобы трахаться всю ночь
Я хочу трахаться с тати, соси мне всю ночь
AP, большие камни, на районе с гориллами
Пять K на обед, приношу триста тысяч дилеру

[Припев: Pop Smoke & Lil Baby]
Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я очень осторожный, как вор в ночи (Бэйби)

[Куплет 2: Lil Baby]
Я богатый, но я катаюсь, у меня мало экзотики, я должен вылететь и получить немного
Ничего не видел, все эти деньги на мне, сотня пачек в сумке, это медовая булочка
Baby OG, я бегал по этим улицам, получил игру из Lashawn
Я сын своей мамы
Выучил о тройном кресте, когда был молодым и я знаю, что не пойду, так что я держу пушку
Я полетел в Париж просто, чтобы купить Dior
Она просит внимания, я не вижу её
C.I.P Pop, я хочу, чтобы ты мог увидеть нас
Я и Cash плюс кто бы то ни был, я иду снова
У получил ниггеров на улице, не побьёшь меня
Я получил индустрию, пытаешься быть мной
Я просто Рэй Чарльз, они не могут увидеть меня
Я в Rolls-Royce с RiRi

Пытаюсь потрахаться в V, это хорошо (Давай трахаться)
Мы не можем испачкать мои сиденья, потому что они белые (Это мои сиденья, смотри на мои сиденья)
Я живу, как в ""Thriller"", я выхожу только ночью
Она не трахается с ликёром, не любит быть выпившей
Она не пьёт Henny, только белое вино (Что она делает?)
Открыл пробку в новом Pinot Grigio (Да)
Подъехал на Porsche с причудливой шлюхой (Зум)
Паркую Porsche и подъезжаю на Lambo (Хмф)
Я выпрыгиваю, Майор Пейн, раскачиваю камуфляж (Да сэр)
Думаю она милая, заставляю её трахаться, дай её мужчине идти (Она милая)
Люблю стрелять, зажигать тебя, сука, я Рембо
Кубинская ссылка полна камней, это чокер (Ох)
Покойся с миром Pop, заставь меня скурить тебя

Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я очень осторожный, как вор в ночиEmbed"

Blue cheese
I swear I'm addicted to blue cheese
I gotta stick to this paper like loose leaf (Huh)

You can have your bitch back, she a groupie
She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat (Gag)
Swagged out
For Milly, we bringing them gats out
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house
Off the '42, I'm blowing her back out (Blowing her back out)

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

DJ Khaled

[Verso 1: Lil Baby e Lil Durk]
Risquei um milhão da minha lista de objetivos três anos atrás
Adicionei dois zeros no um, eu tô em um modo diferente
Essa é a minha vida, faço o que eu quero, eu tô com putas diferentes
Você sabe qual é a jogada, eu peguei ela e mandei pra casa
Eu fiquei muito rico, nós colocamos e retiramos
Você sabe que o Trappy acabou de sair, eu não tenho que colocá-lo na linha
Somos aqueles que tem os números, que colocaram a cidade no mapa
Estamos no meio do verão, eu coloquei um moletom
Meu tempo de braveza não é nada bom
Eu tento não vestir a mesma coisa duas vezes
Eu saí de um jogo de dados, yeah
Meu irmãozinho não tá vivendo direito
Minha irmã e eles estão bem
Meu primo e eles ainda servindo à vida, yeah
Vi um ladrão roubando a religião
Eu vi um pregador ser pego por trair
Eu vou falir o banco por um do meu povo
Eu disse: ""Eu sou o único"", eles não acreditaram em mim
Eu mostro os fatos pra eles, agora todos precisam de mim
Eu vou ter grana enquanto estiver respirando
Eles tornam isso difícil, essa merda é muito fácil, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Refrão: Lil Baby]
Eu vou acabar com um hater em cada chance que tiver
Eu quero o maior relógio que eles têm, não me importo se essa merda vai machucar o meu pulso
Todas essas putas transam com todos nós, eu gostaria de mandar naquela vadia
Elas ficam excitadas quando pegam nas armas, nós temos um armário cheio de peças
Assim que eles dizem que não podemos ir, você sabe que vamos correr em volta daquela porra
Você pode sentir a minha falta com essa merda, você sabe que eu vivo na mistura (Dinheiro, carros e roupas e putas)
Você sabe que eu vivo na mistura (Dinheiro, carros e roupas e putas)

[Verso 2: Lil Baby, DJ Khaled e Lil Durk]
Yeah, ela acha que eu sou um rapper normal, eu não sou
Uma pessoa veio me dizer, nós fuzilamos o seu quarteirão
Me observe levar essa merda pro topo, yeah (Continue)
Coloquei roupas da Givenchy nos meus filhos
Ela deve pensar que um mais um é três
Eu não posso te apoiar pessoalmente
Ela não tem hipoteca, foi morar com a sobrinha
Esses manos estão mentindo, os carros são alugados
O mais novo tá no comando, eu falo pelas ruas
Eu tava cochilando, eles acordaram uma fera
Aprendi lutando, costumávamos ter água pro jantar, não tínhamos nada pra comer
Assim que eu te pegar, eles vão olhar melhor pra mim, tipo, ""Caramba, ele tava mexendo comigo"", yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Refrão: Lil Baby]

Eu sou das trincheiras
Os manos são durões na internet, mas realmente estão lá pra chamar a atenção
As vadias ficam conversando como se fossem realmente ricas
Mas realmente ficam implorando pra aparecer nas minhas fotos
Eu vou dar pra ela 40, 50 mil em dinheiro pra abrir um negócio
Eu vou gastar essa merda no dentista
Eu prefiro transar com ela e pagar o aluguel dela por um ano só pra me livrar dos sentimentos dela
Eu tô na Lambo' SUV no meu bairro, ninguém vai me dizer nada
Indo pra Cali, eu pego a minha erva com certeza, ninguém vai me
Mandar nada
Jogo de dados, Craps e Cee-Lo, eu preciso de dinheiro, não me venda merda
O Baby deixou o bairro dele muito bem, yeah, você pode dizer que eles são realmente ricos
Larguei a carga, não tem espaço agora, eu levei ela pro O
Então eu cheguei na Lamb' porque ela é fã do Boonie Moe
Eu tô fechado com a cidade, uh, acabando com toda a oposição
Eu tô por aí com três milhões de dólares em joias, tô em todos os quarteirões
Esse é o hino, mmm-hmm
Coloquei a droga na Fanta, mmm
Rolls SUV preto com bancos brancos, parece que eu tô sentando em um Panda, mmm
Eu amo a minha prima, ela era uma dançarina
Eu amo meu irmão, ele era um golpista
Sentado no meu colo porque eu tô puxando a calcinha dela e eu pego ela por trás, porque ela me chamou de bonito (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Eu tenho que alimentar as ruas, minha pistola vai fazer sangrar pelas ruas
Balaclava na minha cara, às vezes você tem que trapacear
Pra ficar à frente dessa porra (Gangue), bebi lean como se fosse licor
A vida nas ruas vai fazer com que você alcance Deus mais rápido (Yeah, gangue)
Adesivo, AK-40 direto no seu fígado
Deixo o fuzil atingir você igual um Blood ou um Cripper (Gangue)
Flipper, tantos tiros, eu sou um ginasta
Ganhei tanto dinheiro com esses otários, com esses otários (Yeah, gangue)

[Verso 1: 21 Savage]
Eu sou o senhor derrubador dе corpos, a Gangue do Massacre é a sequеstradora de almas
Não é uma F-150 normal, isso é uma Raptor, porra
Sem mentira, sou um mano da rua, não um rapper
O fuzil atingiu ele e ele virou uma putinha
Smith & Wesson, eu tô representando a Gangue 4L
A gente batizou mais manos do que o reverendo (Yeah)
Kappa Alpha, eu e a minha gangue, fazemos todas as etapas
Quem você tá verificando? O tiro dessa FN vai do Oriente até o West End (Gangue)
[Verso 2: Drake]
Yeah
Ouvi dizer que o Papi tá lá fora
E ele tá com o duplo-R conversível lá fora
Verifiquei o tempo e tá ficando realmente estranho lá fora
Eu vou lançar essa merda e fazer esses idiotas descerem igual um maldito—
Tipo de cara que não consegue me olhar nos olhos
Eu desprezo
Quando eu te vejo, é melhor deixar esse maldito orgulho de lado
Muitas vezes, muitas vezes, eu sobrevivi
A treta tá acontecendo, alerta de spoiler, esse cara morre

[Verso 3: 21 Savage]
Ando armado e você sabe que a maconha é pegajosa
Meu dedo coça, a Glock gosta de deixar buracos
Seus atiradores são duvidosos, um punk da rua nunca poderia me desrespeitar
Eu venho direto do 6 e não poupamos os sessenta

[Verso 4: Drake]
Eu transei com ela, com ela também e ela
Eu quis errar e digo pra ela errar, com certeza
Maldito vodu, peguei ele enquanto eu voei com os turcos
Sei que os manos tiveram que atingi-los onde sabíamos que dói

[Refrão: 21 Savage e Drake]
Coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido (Yeah)

Eu tô em toda parte
O Jacob me cobrou 450 mil por uma corrente pequena

Fala pro treinador não me tirar, eu gosto de assistir os jogos até o final
E a minha lírica é insana e os meus parceiros são insanos
Existem cerca de 80 de nós agora, essa é a coisa mais assustadora
O que eles estão fazendo naquele outro lado é constrangedor
Estamos em Paris com isso, cem quilates com isso
Toda essa merda é pro meu filho, porque ele vai herdar

Fendi on my body, but my feet is in Bottega
Bitch, I'm getting money, give a fuck about a hater

[Pre-Chorus: BIA]
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker

[Chorus: BIA]
Ain't gon' keep me 'round no broke shit, that broke shit get old
Ain't gon' keep me 'round no ho shit, these hoes get too bold
I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold
I might paint my coupe white just to match with my toes

[Intro: Drake & Charlotte Day Wilson]
No entiendo porque me culpas
Solo tómame como soy, soy el mismo yo (Sí)
Vista sin sentido para ver
Sí
Vista sin sentido para ver
Ayy

[Verso 1: Drake]
Me siento joven pero me tratan como el OG
Y quieren el chisme en mí, te juro que estas perras son entrometidas
Dijo que puso algo de dinero en mi cabeza, supongo que vamos a ver
No pondré dinero en su cabeza, mis negros me deben
Debo еstar soltero por un tiempo, no puedеs controlarme
Uno, dos, tres, en una carrera, no pueden retenerme
Y muestro mi cara en un caso para que sepas que soy yo
La imitación no es un halago, solo me molesta
Y también me preocupo por eso
Y la tierra que le tiraron a mi nombre
Se convirtió en abono y crecí fuera de ella
Hora de que todos averigüen qué van a hacer al respecto
Las ruedas grandes siguen rodando, rodando
[Coro: Drake]
Estoy afuera, veintinueve, G5, junto al mar
He estado perdiendo amigos y encontrando la paz
Pero, honestamente, eso me suena como un trato justo para mí
Si alguna vez escuché uno y todavía estoy aquí
Afuera, primera línea, Lado sur
He estado perdiendo amigos y encontrando la paz
Honestamente, eso me suena como un trato justo para mí

[Verso 2: Drake]
Mira, no me invites si haces otra fiesta de lástima
Mirando hacia atrás, es difícil decirte por dónde empecé
No sé quién me ama, pero sé que no es todo el mundo
Nunca podré amarla, ella tiene un cuerpo ocupado
Bebé, si me quieres, no puedes aparecer con todo el mundo, nah
No puedes estar follando con cualquiera, sí
Tengo sentimientos por ti, eso es lo que pasa, sí
Sabes que es algo cuando canto sobre eso, sí
Mamá solía tener una discapacidad, pero me dio esta habilidad
Y ahora ella camina con la cabeza en alto y la espalda recta
No creo que me sientas, estoy aquí
Siendo todo lo que dijeron que no sería y no podría ser
No sé qué les pasó a los chicos que dijeron que lo serían
Les dije los veo en la cima y me malinterpretaron
No guardo resentimiento en mi corazón, esa es la madurez
Y ya no nos seguimos más, es con seguridad

Estoy afuera (Sí), veintinueve (Sí), G5, junto al mar
He estado perdiendo amigos y encontrando la paz
Pero, honestamente, eso me suena como un comercio justo
Si alguna vez escuché uno y todavía estoy aquí
Afuera, primera línea, Lado sur (Lado sur)
He estado perdiendo amigos y encontrando la paz
Honestamente, eso me suena como un comercio justo

[Puente: Travis Scott & Charlotte Day Wilson]
No entiendo porque me culpas
Solo tómame como soy, soy el mismo yo (Lo estoy intentando)
Vista sin sentido para ver
Vista sin sentido para ver (Afuera)

[Verso 3: Travis Scott]
Rodando en un Rolls y no hay seguridad
Manejando, motor revolucionado
Tengo una lealtad real, tengo que conseguir mi liberación
Visualiza el centro, mientras salgo a comer
Y escuchan los sonidos crudos cuando me balanceo y tienes sueño (Oh, oh)
Voy a rodar sobre ellos antes de dejarlos rodar sobre mí
Divide este por la mitad, despierta en la armonía (Enfermo)
Preocuparse, enfermar, estoy harto de preocuparme (Enfermar, enfermar)
Es solo una preocupación, prefiero enterrarlos
Estoy hablando de falsos amigos y esqueletos (Sí)
Temprano en la mañana, enséñele las cuerdas a los abogados, vendí un frijol (Está encendido)
Nunca me conformaré, esta mierda se vuelve más oscura que mi melanina (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
En la casa solo, esta mierda se está derrumbando
Desplazándome por mi registro de llamadas, por emojis, cómo los estoy guardando
Del Mar como la playa donde estaba mi puta pero las prefiero
Ese emoji de mariposa me sostiene y todos mis bebés en ellos (Sí)
Madera trasera en tu cara, no se alejará, él consiguió la K en él
Rompí el pan en lugar de ver a los negros romperse (Romperse)
Enviaron un par de perras, como si fuera de la Ciudad del Cabo
Conoce su posición, sabes de culo arriba con boca abajo (vamos)
Nunca estoy contento, dos mil por evento, lo consigo frecuente
Estoy haciendo un gasto, para mí tiene sentido
Estoy dejando caer la parte superior, sin tinte para el látigo
Estoy dejando caer la parte superior, esta perra intenta gastar
Ella dejó caer la parte superior, volvió de nuevo
Fóllala porque ella está en la casa otra vez, compañía (Sí, sí)
La dejé deslizarse cuando realmente no debería deslizarme (Oooh, ooh)
Después de toda la mierda que hice
Mira cómo me devuelven el pago (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Ahora sigue mi ejemplo
¿Dime qué tipo de pago es ese? (Oh, oh-oh), le puse eso a mi hijo
Y mi confianza, si, es lo que es (oh, oh)
[Coro: Drake, Travis Scott, Ambos]
Estoy afuera (Ah-ah, ah-ah), veintinueve, G5 (Ah-ah, ah-ah), junto al mar
He estado perdiendo amigos y encontrando la paz (Ah-ah, ah)
Pero, honestamente, eso me suena como un comercio justo
Si alguna vez escuché uno y todavía estoy aquí
Afuera, primera línea, Lado sur (Lado sur)
He estado perdiendo amigos y encontrando la paz (Oh, oh)
Honestamente, eso me suena como un comercio justo

[Outro: Charlotte Day Wilson]
No entiendo porque me culpas
Solo tómame como soy, soy el mismo yo
Vista sin sentido para ver
Vista sin sentido para ver
Arriba en una montaña (Arriba en una montaña)
Busca por el valle (Busca por el valle)
Me oyes llamar (me oyes llamar)
¿No vendrás a buscarme? (¿No vendrás a buscarme?)
Por favor no me desampares (por favor no me desampares)
De repente (de repente)
Mi corazón se esta rompiendo (Rompiendo)
Lo siento venir, yo, yoEmbed"

Damn, this motherfucker too crazy, Saucii
Let that shit ride, Eighty8
When the shit over, it's over
I don't know what's after or, you know

[Verse]
I keep my gun in my drawers, ducking the sad news (Oh yeah)
My phone say seven missed calls, I know it's bad news
This life had left me so scarred, I'm knowing that's true
Remember times got so hard, I got it tattoed (So hard)
I ain't did no shows but made some bread (Yeah)
I gotta keep the family fed (Yeah, yeah)
Look, just talked to pops about the feds
I ain't gon' lie, he had me scarеd, uh
I feel 'em coming, nigga (Yeah)
I'll keep on running, nigga (Yeah)
If wе go down bad, keep it a hundred, nigga
My girl all in my ear screaming, ""Spend some time""
I promise I'll be here when I can get some time
Right now, I got to get what's mine (For sure)
I'll be thuggin' 'til the end of time
And fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name
Make sure you write the truest in the motherfucking game
On my

By the river, they will carry me
Finally, I'll be resting in peace

Make sure you write the truest in the game
On my tombstone when they bury me (Yeah)

Yeah

[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)
[Verse]
Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)

Nobody tried to let me in, nobody opened doors

See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

Oh-oh, I know You won't (I know You won't)

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals

I ain't seen niggas hit corners in the motherfuckin' 'burbs, huh (Pop out)
Done politickin' with the competition, what's the word? (Yeah)
Put that on my mama, nigga, eight in the process
Niggas tryna tippy-toe through the progress
Tongue-tied when the truth is an object
What's the pros and the cons of this next check?
Wasn't nobody 'round, I was independent
In the '90s, sittin' bum with the windows tinted
Heard a bum got a strap in the party
Who the fuck let this **** in the party?
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up (Ah)
I was seein' double in the projects
Mad at myself, learned to put it to the side
Mama had to cater for the coupe
That we rode after school on the way to Popeyes
And niggas wanna play both sides
It's a red dot, don't get on the wrong red eye
It's a headshot, Damien Kane, woo, them guys
Fuck around and bury two of them guys
I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France
I thought that I told you, I need the advance
Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm fuckin' the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I can not respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swervin' through rumors
Avoidin' the trends and duckin' the hoes
I'm duckin' the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
A bunk on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writin' my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, ho

I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll

[Verse 1]
I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosе guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are high still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the

I love you, I love you, I love you

Champagne poetry, these are the effortless flows, supposedly
Something else is controlling me
Under her pictures live some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me, I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money
Nigga, I'm wilding with your bread, you owe it to me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I don't have to second-guess nothing with no one I love
'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much
Think I got to scale the love back 'cause

[Verse]
The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah

Me fez caminhar na prancha, porque você sabe que eu sou um nadador (Eu vou esperar por você)
Eu deveria ser seu cachorro, mas você me colocou num canil
Garota, coloque uma focinheira nisso, em todos aqueles latidos durante o jantar

[Интро: Дрейк]
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, так что знай: я в деле
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, шлюха, знай: я в деле
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, так что знай: я в деле
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, шлюха, знай: я в деле
Йеа, жизнь
Жизнь — единственное, в чём мы нуждаемся
Им же нужно избавиться от меня, но я не хочу уходить
Покойся с миром, Лил Кид
[Куплет 1: Дрейк]
Нахуй голубятню, я — сова, совершенно другой уровень
Мог бы заставить её набить шестёрку на мизинце
Слышал, ты фанатеешь по баскетболу, просто дай мне знать
Будешь сидеть на играх в первом ряду, а не в далеке
Всё впоряде, детка, по крайней мере, сейчас
Не хочу стрессовать из-за суки, ведь скромности у меня не отнять
Ещё я готовлю амбиции прямо на кухонной плите
Травка уже кипит, смотри на пенку, хорошо пойдёт
Шлюхи говорят я обходителен, поэтому не попаду в лапы RICO
Бро считает себя Джоном Уэйном, купил ему жёлтых камней
Мне нравятся их тусовочки, детка, нахуй силикон
Все люди сейчас фейковые, ты могла бы разгадать мой шифр
Всё покрою брюликами и розовым золотом
Говорю с вами на языке дредов, словно Джей Коул
Могу сказать её минет хорош перед тем, как это узнать
Сучка, не строй из себя модель, если не была на обложке Vogue
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Они не пишут рэп, но могли бы выдать пару строк
Покойся с миром, Драма Кинг, мы с тобой умели показать стиль
Не нравится, как я говорю? Ниггер, скажи сам что-то
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Подьезжаем и ты узнаешь нас, басс бомбит нехило
Не нравится, как я говорю? Скажи сам что-то
Убирайся с моего пути, ниггер

Мой брат держит руль, пока я стреляю, командная работа (21)
Задаёшь много вопросов, сука, не строй с себя Надеску
Ствол любит ощущать оппов, мой растлитель (21)
Я со своей пушкой, как Розей с лимонным перцем
Ей хочется услышать афробит, ведь она закинулась Теслой
Весь на воркауте, ниггер представляет, что он рестлер
Но это не UFC, ствол шьёт, будто с компрессора (21)
Ствол шьёт, будто с компрессора (Ссыкло)
Ствол шьёт, будто с— (Ссыкло)

На месте Уилл Смита я врезал бы ему пушкой
Поднимай руки вверх, это ограбление (21)
Езжу по району, где мне сосут хуй (Факт)
Если хочешь вести здесь свои дела, то придётся брать ствол (21, 21)
А то бегаешь вокруг в страхе, подбери своё дерьмо (21)
Влюбился так, что голова идёт кругом, вот как я кручусь на районе (21)
Безумно люблю своего Boy'я, мой брат-близнец (21)
Если ниггеры продолжат диссить, то налетим опять на них (21)
Мы — причина, почему у оппов нет друзей (21)
Последний, кто хотел поиграть со мной, стал призраком
Я не зароллил его в Woods, ведь он заплесневел уже
Ты спрашиваешь, как её дела, я только что сказал прийти ей и заняться сексом
Выстрелил в него двадцать раз, блять, ниггер везунчик (Блять, ниггер везунчик)

[Verse 1]
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

E os atiradores chegaram e o coro cantou

[Verso 6: Drake]
Eu tô em toda parte
O Jacob me cobrou 450 mil por uma corrente pequena
US Open, com a nossa presença no jogo de tênis
Fala pro treinador não me tirar, eu gosto de assistir os jogos até o final
E a minha lírica é insana e os meus parceiros são insanos
Existem cerca de 80 de nós agora, essa é a coisa mais assustadora
O que eles estão fazendo naquele outro lado é constrangedor
Estamos em Paris com isso, cem quilates com isso
Toda essa merda é pro meu filho, porque ele vai herdar

[Interlúdio: 21 Savage]
Se o Young Metro não confiar em você, vou atirar em você
Gangue
Metro

[Refrão: 21 Savage]
Coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido
Coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido
Mano, coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido
Coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido
Mano, coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido
Coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido

14,Broadway Girls,Lil Durk Featuring Morgan Wallen,2022,"TranslationsEnglishEspañolLil Durk - Broadway Girls ft. Morgan Wallen (ترجمه‌ی فارسی) Lyrics[Intro: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
2 AM at a Broadway bar
ساعت 2 بامداد تو یه بار تو خیابون برادوی
She's puttin' her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
شماره اش رو میزنه تو گوشیم (دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don't mean
دوتا بطری آبجو بادلایت تا آخر خورده شده،  و چیزایی میگه که منظوری نداره
And you know
و میدونی که

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
تو رستوان بار ""اَلدنز نشویل"" دیدمش
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
گفت که حدود یک مایل دورتر من رو در حال قدم زدن دید
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
پسر خاله ام ""بین"" فقط میخواست تلفنش رو ازش بگیره (تا ازم فیلم نگیره) و همین لبخندش رو از بین بر
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
گفت زیادی مست و دیوونه ام، نحوه رقصیدنم رو دوست نداره
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
گفتم: مجبور نیستی بهم ملحق بشی. گفت شانسشو امتحان میکنه
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
از وقتی که نقشه ام شکست خورد یه جورایی دیوونه بودم
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
یه جورایی گم شدم، و این چیزی بود که فهمیدم
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
دخترای مثل تو فقط میخوان من رو دور بزنن، دور بزنن، دور بزنن
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, there's two things that you'rе gonna find out
اوه، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only lovе you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
اگه زرنگ بودم، میموندم خونه
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Leave them Broadway girls alone
دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
اهالی شهرشون بهم گفتن: بهشون (به دخترای برادوی) اعتماد نکن
Broadway girls a trap
دختر اهل برادوی یه تله است
They on me, they tryna finesse me
مهمون منن، سعی میکنن زرنگی کنن
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
منو با ""مرگان"" دیدن و میدونن رپ میکنم
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
اسب من (ماشینم) پورشه، بهم توجه میکنن
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
پریدم رو یه اسب، اونم نشست پشتم
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
رفتم بار تا واسش یه نوشیدنی بگیرم
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
بهم گفت رپ دوست نداره، آهنگ های ""پینک"" رو گوش میده
I can't run out of money
نمیتونم بی پول بشم (معنی دوم: نمیتونم بدون پول ادامه بدم)
The trenches love me forever
محله های فقیرو خلافکار همیشه دوستم دارن
They treat me like Ed in London
مثل ""اد شیرن"" تو لندن باهام رفتار میکنن
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
بردمش استخر، بعدش رایگان یه آبجو گرفتم
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
بوت های ""تیکوواس""، گیتار، سیگار، بار مشروب
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
مثل ماشین ها سوار گاو نر میشه، معمولا با آدم معروفا خوب نیس

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, think I oughta settle down
اوه، فکر کنم باید به اینن وضع عادت کنم
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
و یه چیزی پیدا کنم تا بتونم باهاش برگردم به شهر خودم، اوه
But I told 'em that I'm savage
ولی بهشون گفتم که من رام نمیشم
They just tryna tell me there's
اونا فقط میخواستن بهم بگن:
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
There's two things that you're gonna find out
دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only love you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

15,What Happened To Virgil,Lil Durk Featuring Gunna,2022,"TranslationsEspañolWhat Happened To Virgil Lyrics[Intro: King Von]
Banger
Oh yeah, I'm finna make a banger with this one

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Last time you told me you proud of me, you wasn't proud of me, you was the nigga who doubted me
I was too mad at you, you let 'em come kill you, my brother, that shit was a tragedy
But magically, I got the strategy, I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me
""Who was the killers between the hood?"" (DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
Bro, I'm a king, that mean we good
Talked to my tete about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my chopper
Before I was twelve, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?
Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Stopped taking drugs, had to sit in a sauna
How you gon' blame me? I gave her Gabbana
Bitch, I'm a star, gotta use condom
Don't drink Par, only like Wocka
Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my pocket, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, high speed, no tossin'
Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch, my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you
Get out my business, that shit don't concern you
I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you
I love the trenches, this shit is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (Oh no, oh)
Gave my bro twenty, he caught for a burglary
I love the bitches who say they ain't heard of me
Ever seen blood? That shit'll turn burgundy
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and got some more problems
We from the sandbox, my dawg since a toddler
Sixteen years old when I shot my first chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa-locka
Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters (Fly helicopters)
I count every blessin', they count every dollar
I'm 'bout to go factory plain
I treat all of my dawgs the same
Take care all of my bitches the same
I just hope you financially sane
Never turning my back on the gang
From the A, we was taught to be brave
Had to squabble and take a few fades
Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase
Damn my nigga, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered
I got style, I don't know what you heard of
You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile
Only real ones throughout my circle
Only real ones throughout my circle, oh
R.I.P. Prince, I'ma pour up some purple
600 Maybach, the one with the curtain
Young GunnaWunna, the boy bought the Birkin
I'm goin' hard, know you proud of me workin'
Ridin' round the town sippin' and swervin'
Hold it down, do this shit with a purpose
Louis down, man, this shit came from Virgil
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada
Bro get this money like it's my religion
It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas
That try to compare whatever I did
Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig
I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid
I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib
I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's
Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in
I give you my fully, no matter where I'm in
Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean
You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win
Niggas can't see me, ain't no competition
Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist
I'm never sober, don't think I'ma quit

[Hook: Nardo Wick]
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Nigga, wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Nigga, wer will mit mir rauchen?
[Part 1: Nardo Wick]
Wer will mit mir rauchen? Ich versuche, die Lunge eines Niggas zu zerstören
Sie sind wie, „Nardo, nimm die verdammten Waffen hoch“
Scheiß drauf, sag': „Großer Bruder, hol die Waffen raus“
Wenn es raucht, können wir Runden drehen, während die Sonne scheint
Mir fehlt es nie an etwas, ich tanke mit gezogener Pistole
Schrei raus, „Was ist passiert?“ Dann mach dich an die Arbeit, bis sie zu Ende ist
All diese Niggas verstecken sich, und ich bin so, wo sind sie? Es macht keinen Spaß mehr
7.62s groß wie die Hölle, werden einem Nigga die Lunge aus dem Körper sprengen
Eins, zwei, drei, vier (Tret’ die Tür ein, leg dich auf den Boden)
Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht (Mach keinen Lärm, sonst fresse ich dein Gesicht)
Neuen, zehn, elf, wir sagen die Nummer nicht, wir hängen nicht mit Jakes
Ich werde vierzehn Niggas töten, wenn dreizehn Schlampen-Niggas spielen
Ich glaube, mein Draco könnte schwul sein (Wieso?), denn er bläst Niggas
Ich habe gerade einen brandneuen Lolli bekommen, das ist ein Four-Nickel
Nennt mich Nardo Ja-Mann, ich kenne nicht einen Nigga
Du kannst deinen besten Mann schicken, du wirst deinen besten Hitter verlieren

[Bridge: Nardo Wick & Lil Durk]
Was zum Fick ist das?
Was zum Fick ist das?
So trete ich auf Niggas
(Wie ich auf diese Nigga-Schlampen trete, yeah, Mann, was?)

[Part 2: Lil Durk]
Sie sind auf meiner Seite und sagen: „Slide für Von“, ich weiß, dass sie mich trollen (Cap)
Draußen mit euch allen großen Homies, seid dabei, ich behalte die Leute bei mir (Bop)
Ich habe es wieder im Blut, ihr wisst es nur nicht, so sollte es sein (Psch)
Rief ihn für ein Feature an, nur um ihn zu töten, weil wir wissen, dass er süß ist (Grrah, grrah)
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, wer zum Fick ist das?
Bruder, sieh an der Tür nach, schau aus dem Fenster und vergiss die Strap nicht (Los geht's)
Ich bin am Arsch, wenn ich Opps sehe, vergesse ich, dass ich rappe (Ja, tue ich)
Ich bin immer dabei, egal, wo ich bin, das habe ich von der 'Raq gelernt
Er wird alles trinken, was ihm ein Nigga verkauft, nur um zu sagen, dass er high ist
Wenn ein Nigga stirbt, sagen sie: „Er war nicht mal bei dem Scheiß dabei“ (Er ging)
Die Notaufnahme wird euch immer anlügen, wenn ein Nigga stirbt (Wahr)
Sagen, dass ein Nigga stabil ist, nur um euch ruhig zu halten (Los geht’s)
Bronem stampft ihn
Tu besser, was Nardo sagt, denn Nigga sterben beim Tanken (Boom)
Warum tust du so, als wäre das etwas Exklusives? Schlampe, das ist ein öffentlicher Arsch (Öffentlicher Arsch)
Kann kein Nigga, mit dem wir nicht ficken, vorbeikommen, stampfen wir ihn
Nardo spricht, schleich dich aus dem Schnitt, wir mögen pscht, pscht
Nardo spricht, fang ihn, bevor er wegläuft, die Pistole macht pscht, pscht (Grrah)
Ey, wen hast du getötet? Du redest ständig, als wäre es eine Übung (Gang)
Wir werden dich nüchtern töten, wer hat dir gesagt, dass ich eine Pille brauche? Gang

Alte Niggas, die ständig versuchen zu dissen, sollen sich von meinem Schwanz verpissen
Wir erwischten ihn beim Verlassen des Bingos mit seiner Schlampe und schickten einen Blitzer
Nardo versucht, mit mir um den Stock zu streiten, er ist an der Reihe zu schießen
Ich kann nicht mal meine Opps in Scheiße wälzen, Pussys gibt es nicht
Eins, zwei, drei, vier Niggas sind sauer, dass ich die Hure gefickt habe
Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht Pussys, die mit diesem K getroffen wurden
Neun, zehn, elf, zwölf, haben keine L's, sie müssen jagen
Dreizehn, vierzehn, fünfzehn, sechzehn Hohlspitzgeschosse, sie treffen sein Gesicht

Neun, zehn, elf, zwölf, keine Maske, immer noch nicht im Knast (Brr)
100K-Checks in der Post
Lege das nur für die Kaution zurück
All das Crack, das wir verkauft haben
Das Haus der Tante riecht immer noch so
Fans sind verdammt negativ
Scheiß drauf, ich habe mich einfach durchgesetzt

Zielt auf die Schlampe, schießt überall hin
No Limit, es interessiert mich nicht
Drehe Runden im Block, sie sind nie da (Pussy)

Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that shit look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on

[Verse 2]
Bae, don't put me on your camera, you know what I look like
She like, ""Put it in me raw,"" I asked her like, ""What I look like?""
Bae, just call me when you get here, you know I don't book flights
We can't pop out, it won't even look right
I just hit the woman of my dreams with another bitch
I done scratched ten million off my bucket list
I'm never on no sucker shit
My city stand behind me, that's why I love this shit
Buildin' up for my kids' kids' kids, I ain't gon' never quit
Investin' my money in all type of shit, ownership
Please don't involve me in all that messy shit, I don't want the bitch
I put twenty-sixes on my Cullinan, that country shit
Buildin' up my audience, I'm all in other countries with it
Maxin' out my debit cards in one store
Take a pretty girl and give her what she want, I'm just having fun
Catch me cuttin' up in that ZR1, it's the fast kind
I done got my shit together, I'm way better than last time, yeah

28,By Your Side,Rod Wave,2022,"TranslationsPortuguêsBy Your Side Lyrics[Intro]
Pipe that shit up, TnT
Where the fuck is Rod Wave?
Hey

[Verse]
It's November, where the fuck is Rod Wave?
Young nigga way outta state
Fucked up, gettin' over pain
Look how far a nigga came
You remember I ain't had a thing
Fucked up, walkin' through the rain
At the top of the game, should've seen the niggas I was tryna bring
It's crazy the way these niggas change
Tell the city girl chill, you know baby mama know the deal
She know I could beat that pussy
Okay, let's switch the subject
Notice that both of my wrists is flooded
I been grindin' so hard, gеttin' to this money
I been working like I know the drought is coming
Monday to Monday, Sunday to Sunday, you know I'm street running
Okay, my daddy was a gangstеr, what the fuck that made me?
Niggas claiming that it's love dawg but it can't be
Know I fell in love with guns by the age of thirteen
And my pocket rocket on me, homie don't reach
Fuck dying in my Cuban link, I'm living in my Richard Millie
I just finished my tour, what a wonderful feeling
I got inside my bag and got out my feelings
I'm out my feelings
[Chorus]
Hey there everybody, what's it like in your city?
I'm a thousand miles away but look, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do, oh
Times Square couldn't shine as bright as you
I swear, it's true
Look, look
Hey there everybody, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right here if you get lonely
Give this song another listen, close your eyes
Uh, listen to my voice, it's my disguise
By your, your side
By your side
By your side, yeah, yeah

Hey, oh, yo
Why oh, why oh, why oh, why you keep fuckin' with me?
You gon' make me jump out my skin, believe me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""
Push these bitches off me like, ""Huh""
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' the snakes, I'm pushin' the fakes
I'm pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh"" (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Aha, I be immune to shit (Aha)
Tucking the broom and shit (Aha)
They want to assume and shit (Aha)
Know you a choke, my ancestor close
I howl at the moon and shit (Aha)
Know the rеsults, the ballot is in, man, I'm 'bout to boom again (Aha)
You funny, dawg
Peek-a-boo, can't hide behind your monеy, dawg
A week or two, I meditate on runnin' lost
Swerve, swerve, swerve, shake the currents off, yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""

Pick my daughter up, she need all the love
I need all the love, I mean all of us
It's like six o'clock, bitch, you talk too much
You makin' it awkward, love
I mean, it's hard enough, I mean, it's—

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
They don't fuck with me even if they could
Pull out the stick, hit a bitch with the wood
First to park Rolls Royce, 'vert in the hood
Don't worry about us, over here we good
The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals
I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin' shit out in the cubicle
Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that bitch look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can't ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a nigga fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds
Yeah, you niggas can't stand the rain, you niggas don't stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz
I caught a bale off a Google app
I'm the type to get my shooter whacked
I had to survive off a tuna pack
Five percent tint on the whip like, ""Who was that?""
Coupe take off like it's mad
Beat the dope with a fork, I'm whippin' up Sudafed, I'm doin' scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday's son's day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain't have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles
Audemars water, aqua, beatin' the block up 'til we spot 'em
I don't want your ice, boy, I want your life, but fuck it, I still might rob 'em
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""
Push these bitches off me like, ""Huh""
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' the snakes, I'm pushin' the fakes
I'm pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh"" (Yeah)

33,Me Or Sum,"Nardo Wick, Lil Baby & Future",2022,"Me or Sum Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro: Future]
Drop your location, she think she me or some' (Hendrix)
Put on my chains, now she think she me or some'
She keep a Glock in her bag, she think she me or some' (Pluto)
VVS rocks with the cash, she think she me or some' (Keep it Z3N)

[Verse 1: Future]
Came out hustlin' with the bag, oh no
I can't get it to the gossip
Bitch can't see me in binoculars
Run up the check up in Prada
You runnin' 'em racks up, I'm proud of you
All bad bitch eat seafood
Took the hot box on a detour
Came back, red on the bottom of my shoe
Posted with devils, she thinkin' she me or some'
Canary yellow, she thinkin' she me or some'
Step like a stepper, she drippin' Emilio Pucci
She think she me or some'
She barely ever poppin' outside
But when she do (When she do), tryna kill some'
My number one hitter, always movin' in silence
She the truth, real one
You can ask her if she gang, gang
She gon' tell you she rep the same thing I do (Yeah)
She not my main thing
But on the weekends, she lovin' my crew, lovin' my crew
[Part II]

[Verse 2: Nardo Wick]
She said she got a man, I act deaf, I don't hear her
Come here, girl, stop playin', let me put it in your liver (Put it in your liver)
Eat what's in my pants, bae, don't gotta go to dinner
I stole her heart, thou shall not steal, like I'm sorry, I'm a sinner
Let her put my chains on, now she think she me or somethin'
Got a special ringtone, when it beep, I know she comin'
She just put her hair on, now she think she flee or somethin'
Nardo hit that G spot, when she scream, I know she cummin'
I put her in LV, on my feet is LV
I think I'm a lover boy, sing to your bitch like Elvis
My bitch in the front seat, my other bitch in back seat
Nardo, who your other bitch? I'm talkin' 'bout my choppy
Know I keep a bankroll, ""Baby, count my bankroll""
Put it in your purse, she say, ""It's too much, bae, it won't go
Too much, bae, it won't fold, too much, bae, I'm gon' choke""
I know I got a lot of y'all, but, baby, you my favorite ho

[Bridge: Nardo Wick]
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not

Baby in this bitch like, ""Let me through here""
I need millions for the new year
Send a threat, I send my crew there
Know they hate how big I blew up
Got that check for real, went Audemars Piguet and bought my boo one
Think my favorite car's my blue one, pop that shit for real, I do this
Put my heart inside my safe deposit box 'cause I ain't gon' use it
I made forty million last year, and that's just off my music
I done finally got the mothafuckin' ball, and I ain't gon' lose it
Seem like everybody snoozin' while I'm steadily improvin'
I get money like I'm Jewish, I'm gon' be the one
She got all them bracelets up her arm, look like she me or somethin'
She get new Chanel whenever she want to like it's free or somethin'
I been buyin' Birkin bags for bitches like they three for one
Excuse my French, I'm sorry, mommas, this Phantom cost five hunnid
I been lit for five summers, everyone know how I'm comin'
Real exotic bags for thirty-five, we got our side pumpin'
Niggas don't want war with us, I'll spin until my last hunnid, yeah

[Verse 4: Future]
Rackies on rackies, now she think she me or some'
Dressin' like she tecky, now she think she me or some'
Count up cash really fast, now she think she me or some'
Keep the extendo in her bag, now she think she me or some'
Walked in with a baddie, now she think she me or some'
Gon' drop the addy, now she think she me or some'
Bust down an Audemars, now she think she me or some'
Cop another foreign car, now she think she me or some'
Bitch don't need a stylist, she must think she me or some'
Always goin' viral, she must think she me or some'
Turn up on a bad ho, she must think she me or some'
Diamonds on her rings and her chain, think she me or some'
Posted up, runnin' with her gang, think she me or some'
Flawless, Freeband gang, reppin' like she me or some'

Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm
Tss

[Verse 1]
My nail tech knows how to keep a lil' secret
I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweakin'
I look like I been gettin' money, I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walkin' 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix and I'm handshakin' but most of y'all can't help me (Nah)
Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope), most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and this shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it, like ""What's up?"" (What's up?)
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up (Can't fuck up)
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up (Stuck up)
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out and I chuck 'em up
First listen, they hearin' this shit like, ""What the fuck?""
[Pre-Chorus]
Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over 'Gram, that's my MO (On my momma)
Fuck a close friends, I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload

[Chorus]
Like baow, baow, baow
TSA just opened my book-bag up and my chain hittin' like
Baow, baow, baow, baow
The king's back in his hometown, when them wheels hit and I touchdown they
Baow, baow, baow, baow
She down low, three point stance, I'm back there doin' Jack dance like
Baow, baow, baow, baow

[Verse 2]
And I'm not no fashionista, but I'm fly though (But I'm fly)
And I know I gave up drinkin', but I'm high though (But I'm high)
I told her, ""I don't cum from head, but you can try though"" (You can try)
I'm not on top of this shit yet, but I'm that guy though
I take a look 'round and my comp and it's just, uh (Ooh)
Wide open, big whippin', it slide open (Mm-mm)
I notice they treat me like I'm chosen (I'm chosen)
Eyes open, heart clean and my mind focused
This shit just keeps goin' how I wrote it
How the hell could you doubt us?
I mean, back then it made sense, but it's like, now what?
Now they down to come 'round just to be 'round us
You ain't one of my dawgs, why do you hound us?

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag

Shot a video and had a shootout in the same shirt
What you know about popping out and trying to hit they face first?
They like Smurk, ""Your ass be tripping, better put your case first""
Choking who? I heard them rumors, niggas better play slow
I don't want no niggas who you catch, I want the one I paid for
We on his ass, he in the A, you see how long they stay for
Ain't no hotel room, we pop outside the Hyatt with dracos
Hellcats, they get off any scene, the police chase those
Trolling ass, we shot your homie, we ain't know he can take those
If I say your name, don't post it, opps be on all kind of shit
Ain't got time to watch your page to see if niggas died or shit
I know bitches set you up, literally, niggas dying to hit
In this industry, ain't what it seem, this shit be counterfeit
Ain't no lacking, she say I'm a nigga from the trenches with a accent
Why you asking me who shot your homie, why you asking?
You got my number, you post shit on the 'Gram, you moving backwards
You lucky I don't be doing shit for the 'Gram, you niggas cowards

Take him to the potty, he's a nerd (Pop out)
I ain't seen niggas hit corners in the motherfuckin' 'burbs, huh (Pop out)
Done politickin' with the competition, what's the word? (Yeah)
Put that on my mama, nigga, eight in the process
Niggas tryna tippy-toe through the progress
Tongue-tied when the truth is an object
What's the pros and the cons of this next check?
Wasn't nobody 'round, I was independent
In the '90s, sittin' bum with the windows tinted
Heard a bum got a strap in the party
Who the fuck let this **** in the party?
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up (Ah)
I was seein' double in the projects
Mad at myself, learned to put it to the side
Mama had to cater for the coupe
That we rode after school on the way to Popeyes
And niggas wanna play both sides
It's a red dot, don't get on the wrong red eye
It's a headshot, Damien Kane, woo, them guys
Fuck around and bury two of them guys
I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France
I thought that I told you, I need the advance
Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm fuckin' the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I can not respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swervin' through rumors
Avoidin' the trends and duckin' the hoes
I'm duckin' the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
A bunk on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writin' my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, ho
