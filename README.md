## Summary of project 
In this presentation we will discuss if rappers are eloquent geniuses or as obscene as many assume us to be. For this, we looked at the yearly top 50 rap songs of the last 5 years and investigated their lyrics to find out, let’s have a look.

We start our analysis by calculating how original each rapper is. For this we measured the ratio of unique words they use. It seems that there are some big differences between the top performers like Kid Coodie with almost 50% unique words, and the favorite Drake with less than 15%...
Looking at the average length of the words used in the songs, Doja Cat tops the charts with around 4.4 characters per word. However, even Doja Cat does not reach the average of the English language at around 4.8! Seems like rappers could work on fitting a few more syllables into their lines.



To compare the English in rap songs and in usual English, we found the most used words in both by comparing their relative frequencies.

As you can see, the most used words in english are new, home and us. However, in our rap dataset we found get, yeah, I’m, like, and some swearwords. We immediately notice that two swearwords made it in the top 10 most used words.



On this slide you can see the most common swear words in both english and rap and how frequently they appear. It seems that everyday English speakers swear mostly about sexual things, while in rap it seems to be insults. In this plot we can already get an idea of how much more vulgar rappers are. The most common swear makes up 1 point 2 % of the corpus, while it is about a sixteenth of a percent in English.

Now take a look at the most common swear words in rap. Since i don’t want to offend anyone, i won’t read them out loud. Thanks for understanding!

We did however find the most vulgar rappers, according to our data those would be Sheck Wes at number one with almost 30 % of his lyrics being made up of swears, closely followed by Flipp Dinero  and Lil Pump.

We also wanted to compare the amount of vulgar language between regular English and rap. As it turns out, rappers are actually about 10 times as vulgar as the average english speaker. Therefore, I have to admit that saying rappers are vulgar is valid.

Lastly we wanted to find out whether more vulgar songs ranked higher in the charts. In our analysis we didn’t find any significant correlation though.

In summary, while rappers may have a colorful vocabulary when it comes to swear words and creative wordplay, one thing's for sure: they never shy away from dropping some sick heat.
